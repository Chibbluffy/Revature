#Node.js
- Runtime environment for JavaScript
	- Ryan Dahl of Google created this
- Not the first server side JS environment
	- But was the first GOOD one
	- Actually very performant
	- Could hold its own against Java or Python
- Node.JS uses the V8 JS Engin
	- same engine that Chrome browser uses
- Very popular backend
	- part of the JS everywhere paradigm
- Node Package Manager (NPM)
	- like Maven, but for Node.js

#TypeScript
- TypeScript is a super set of JS
	- ANY JS is also valid TS
	- TS has additional features
	- Javascript that scales
- Statically but not strongly typed language
	- can optionally use types
	- but values can still be coerced and it is not enforcable
- Origins of TypeScript
	- JS has a lot of flaws
	- Dynamic coercive nature of JS lends itself to errors
		- Objects without properties you are looking for
		- calling functions with incorrect argument types/parameters
		- Not knowing the Type return of a function
		- Accidentally making global
	- This part of JS made it very difficult to scale to large applications
	- Microsoft Devs really liked JS and wanted to create a version that would scale better
- This core feature of TypeScript is that it has Typing
- TS itself cannot be run.
	- transpiled into JS to actually be executed
- VS Code is written in TS
- TS beat Python for most loved language. Rust is still #1
