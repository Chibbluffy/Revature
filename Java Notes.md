#Java Basics
- High level language
- Automatic memory managements
	- Garbage collection
	- explicitly designed to prevent writing pointers
- Strongly typed
	- cant coerce value
- Statically typed
	- All var must have type when created, and methods must have return types
- compiled language
	- write .java
	- compile to .class file
	- write once, run anywhere
- Scalable
	- python readable
	- JS flexible
- very OOP
	- other than primitives and lambdas, very OOP
- Widely used in enterprise
- Java Bean**
	- encapsulated, private vars. Empty constructor. Getters and setter


#Review
- High level features of Java
	- Strongly and statically typed language
	- Compiled language
		- write .java source code, execute a .class java byte code
	- WORA (Write once run anywhere)
		- Any Java application will run the same on any machine with a JVM
	- **JDK vs JRE vs JVM**
		- **JDK**: Java Development Kit
			- Needed by developers ONLY
			- Contains compiler, and tool that turns .java to .class
		- **JRE**: Java Runtime Environment
			- Needed to run any java application
			- what most people have
		- **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine
			- Virtual Memory and Processors
	- Java is 99% OOP language
		- primitives
		- lambdas
	- Extensive libraries and enterprise software
	- Designed to be very scalable
	- Automatic Memory Management
		- Garbage collection
	- Java is 100% pass by value
		- When calling function you are not actually passing in an object. Instead you are passing in a copy of the objects memory address. 
- Pillars of OOP (APIE)
	- **Abstraction**
		- hiding implementation details
		- Dont need to know how something works, only how to use it
			- interfaces and abstract classes
				- code to an interface but do not need to know the implementation class
	- **Polymorphism**
		- One object, many labels
			- A reference variable can refer to an object by any legitimate parent class or interface
		- Runtime Polymorphism
			- Overriding: Child class overrides/changes implementation of an inherited method
			- SAME method signature but different implementation
		- Static Polymorphism
			- Overloading: Same method name, different parameters
			- Has to be done in the same class
	- **Inheritance**
		- Ability of classes to inherit the fields and methods(properties) of another class
		- Allows us to avoid repeating the same code
		- Allows creation of logical hierarchies
	- **Encapsulation**
		- Protecting our methods and fields from other parts of code
		- Done with Access Modifiers
			- MODIFIERS ARE NOT SCOPES
			- public: accessible anywhere
			- protected: package and inherited packages
			- default: package
			- private: class
	- Abstract classes vs interfaces
		- Abstract class 
			- cannot directly instantiate
			- must ALWAYS build a child class
			- Can have concrete methods (methods with implementation)
			- Can have abstract methods (methods with no implementation)
			- Can have fields
			- Abstract classes can ONLY be inherited
		- Interface
			- Only abstract methods
				- there is a default keyword
			- All variables are public static and final
			- implement as many interfaces as you want
			- functional interface: Interface with a single method signature used to create lambdas
			- Marker interface: is empty and used solely to give a type to a class
	- Constructors
		- special method that creates an instance of a class and sets it up
		- must be named the same as the class name
		- can overload constructors as much as you want
		- the only methods in java that do not have a return type
		- Every constructor starts with a call to super which creates the parent object
	- Object class
		- grandparent class that every other class in java inherits from
		- everything is of type object
		- important methods
			- Equals()
				- returns boolean if object is equal
			- toString()
				- returns a string representation of the object
				- default is to print memory address
	- Wrapper classes
		- object versions of primitives
		- provide utility of an object with methods
		- are a bit slower than primitives as it has to be instantiated
		- Autoboxing
			- primitive to wrapper
		- unboxing
			- wrapper to primitive
	- Exception Handling
		- Exception is an object that holds information about the failure 
		- Exceptions are throwable
		- Keywords
			- try
				- please run this code
			- catch
				- if an exception is thrown, catch and deal with it
			- finally
				- always executes 
			- Throw
				- sends flying and exception
			- Throws
				- warning on method signature that a certain exception can be generated
		- Checked Exceptions / Compile time exceptions
			- Exceptions which MUST be handled in your code in order for it to compile
			- Design choice to FORCE devs to handle failures
		- Unchecked Exceptions / Runtime exceptions
			- exceptions you are not required to handle
			- but you should
		- Error
			- A catastrophic failure
			- Cannot be recovered from
			- Must rewrite code
	- Collections Framework
		- The CF is a series of interfaces and classes whose main purpise is to hold objects
		- Iterable is the top of the collection framework
		- Key interfaces
			- List 
				- maintains order of insertion
				- allows duplicates
			- Set
				- does not maintain order
				- does not allow duplicates
			- Queue
				- FIFO
			- Map 
				- Does not implement Collection or Iterable interface
				- Stores objects as key value pairs
	- Generics
		- <> diamond brackets/angle brackets
		- Allow us to set a type for certain interfaces or classes
		- Used heavily in collections to restrict what type of object is allowed to be stored in a particular collection   
		```
		List<String> strings = new ArrayList<String>();
		```  
		- Also accepted, but not good for Java, a strongly and statically typed language  
		```List strings = new ArrayList();``` 
		 
	- Scopes of a variable
		- THERE IS NO GLOBAL SCOPE
		- Class/Static scope
			- attached to the class itself
			- only one copy
		- Instance/object scope
			- Attached to the object
			- one copy per object
		- method scope
			- variables passed into a function
		- Local/block scope
			- variables defined within a function
	- Functional Programming
		- a different paradigm of programming than OOP
		- Lambdas
			- ability to store a defined piece of code in a variable
			- pass lambdas to other methods to use
			- a lambda passed as an argument iss called a callback function
		- Creating a lambda in Java
			- Functional Interface  
		```MyLambda func = (arguments) -> {code};```   
		
		- Examples
			- Comparator
			- Runnable
			- Collections.sort(list, lambda)
	- String
		- String is an object, not a primitive
		- Strings use a string pool
			- strings of same value are the same object in memory
			- Saves on memory
			- Strings are immutable and cannot be changed once created
		- StringBuilder
			- Mutable version of string
			- Directly modify value
			- Much more efficient for character manipulations
		- StringBuffer
			- Thread-safe version of string builder
- Design Patterns
	- Java beans
		- any class that has private fields
		- public getters and setter
		- no args constructor
		- technically implements serializable, but not supposed to do that anymore
	- Factory
		- method that returns an implementation of an interface
		- allows a developer to pass in arguments for what they want and the method will choose the best option. the dev does not need to know it
			- ArrayList vs LinkedList example
	- Dependency Injection
		- Create an object by passing in the other objects (dependencies) it needs to function 
		- ```BookService bserv = new BookService(new BookDaoLocal());```
- JUnit
	- The most popular testing framework in Java
	- We are using JUnit 5 (latest version)
	- Annotations
		- @Test
		- @TestMethodOrder
		- @Order(1)
		- a LOT more
- TDD
	- Write tests first
	- If you are not doing TDD you are doing BUG driven development
	- First design interface
	- Second design tests for that interface
	- Third write the implementation of that interface
	- Pros:
		- Spot bugs early
		- Build upon reliable code/tests
		- Much easier to write code if you can test it constantly
- Threads
	- Thread is a path of execution through a program
	- Thread is a multi-threaded language
		- Run multiple threads  in parallel/simultaneously
		- Can optimize performance
		- Can lead to consistency bugs
		- Significantly harder to write good reliable multi-threaded code
	- Make Thread
	- Create a runnable lambda
	- Pass it into the constructor of a Thread Class
		- To start the thread
		- ```Thread.start();```
		
- Gradle
	- Build Tool (it builds software applications)
		- Platform agnostic technically
		- Can be used for any platform (Java, C, Ruby, etc)
	- Main file for any project built with gradle is ```build.gradle```
		- a script that builds the project
		- Sets name, 
		- builds external libraries, dependencies
	- Gradle is written in Groovy
