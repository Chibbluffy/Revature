#Week 2 Review
##HTTP
- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- Main way (protocol) information is sent on internet
- request/response based system
	- send HTTP Request
	- receive HTTP Response
- HTTP Request anatomy
	- URL-Uniform Resource Location (Where request is going)
		- http://cnn.com/news
		- URI-Uniform Resource Identifier ()
			- /news
	- Verb
		- GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS
	- Body (payload)
		- GET requests have no body
		- The body can hold data in any format, but JSON is most common
	- Version of HTTP
	- Headers
		- Key Value pairs that contain information about the request
		- Meta-information
			- Authentication keys
			- Access tokens
- HTTP Response anatomy
	- Version of HTTP
	- Headers
	- Body (optional)
	- Status code
		- numeric indicator on how a request was processed
			- 100s info
			- 200s successes
			- 300s redirects
			- 400s client errors
			- 500s server errors
				- really bad. API was designed very bad
		- 
- JSON
	- JavaScript Object Notation
	- the most popular way to send information
	- formatted string
		- a data type that any programming language can process and easily parse int own objects
		- `{"fname":"Tom","age":24}`
- REST
	- REpresentational State Transfer
		- Representational- the response you get back is a representation of the object, not the object itself
			- get back a JSON, not a Java Object
			- Could be any format, but JSON is usually what it is
			- Sometimes XML
	- Type of webserver architecture
		- The most popular type of web service
	- Resources
		- Collection of objects that you want to keep track of
	- 6 REST constraints that a web server must follow to be considered truly RESTful
		1. Uniform interface
			- standards by which you name the endpoints/routes/URIs of the application
			- Resources are often nested if applicable
			- What HTTP verbs do to each endpoint
				- GET /doctors
					- should return all doctors
				- GET /doctors/12
					- should return a doctor identified with 12
				- POST /doctors
					- should CREATE a new doctor
				- PUT /doctors/14
					- should UPDATE doctor identified with 14
				- DELETE /doctors/20
					- should DELETE doctor identified with 20
		2. All Requests to a REST API should be self-contained
			- One http request is not dependent on another for correct processing
##Javalin
- Web servers can be written in any programming language
- Javalin is a Java library for writing web servers
	- (Later we will do Spring MVC/WEB)
	- (Very similar to Node.js/Express)
- Create a Javalin Object `Javalin app = Javalin.create()`
	- attach routes to the object
	- `app.get("/doctors/:id", getDoctorsHandler);`
- Event driven program
	- Listen for an event
	- When that event occurs you execute a lambda
- Path parameters
	- /doctors/:id
- Query parameters
	- /doctors?specialty=neurology
- Query vs path
	- query params are mostly filters, optional
		- no result is empty data
	- path params are more of identifiers
		- no result is 404 error

	
##App layering
- Controllers can call ANY services it wants/needs
	- primarily call the service sharing its name
- Services can call ANY daos it wants/needs
	- primarily calls the DAO sharing its name
- DAOs should only communicate with the database concerning the object is named for

##SQL
- Structured Query Language
	- The main programming language for relational databases
- Database
	- Persists information 
	- Relational databases persist information in tables connected to each other
- Versions of SQL
	- Postgres
	- MySQL
	- OracleSQL
- Schema
	- The layout of a database, metadata, anything that isnt the data itself
	- The tables and any rules regarding those tables
		- constraints, primary keys, foreign keys, not null, etc
		- ERD Entity Relationship Diagram
			- visual representation of schema
- Constraints
	- any restrictions put on a column
		- primary keys, foreign keys, not null, check
- SQL SubLanguages
	- DDL Data Definition Language - define schema of database
		- Create, Drop, Alter
	- DML Data Manipulation Language - Modifies data in table
		- Insert, Update, Delete
	- DQL Data Querying Language - Gets data from table
		- select
	- DCL Data Control Language - controlling access and permission to a database
		- creating users/developers for a database, etc.
		- In real world, no dev would have 100% complete unrestricted access to a databases
		- Grant, Revoke
	- TCL Transactional Control Language - 
		- commit, rollback
- Multiplicity
	- Tables have relationships to other tables
	- One-One
		- not seen very much, bc usually can be all in one table
	- One-Many
		- Player to Team
	- Many-Many
		- Player to Game
		- Requires a Junction Table
- Primary key
	- unique identifier for a record
	- unique and not null
	- usually numeric and autogenerated
- Foreign key
	- a column on a child table that references a *primary key on a parent table
	- the foreign key is the many in a one-many relationship


##Normalization
- process of removing redundancy in a database
- Done to free up space 
- makes transactions faster to process on highly normalized databases
	- updates and insertions take longer the more columns a table has
- 1nf
	- primary key
	- all columns must be atomic
		- data cannot be broken down into anything more meaningful
		- no column should contain array-like information
- 2nf
	- 1nf
	- No functional dependencies
	- could not calculate one column value with another
- 3nf
	- 2nf
	- No transitive dependencies
	- the data in a column could not be found elsewhere in the database
	- no amount of joins can get you this info
- Normalization is not always better
	- highly normalized data is tough to query
	- have to perform many joins to get on piece of info

##Joins and Sets
- combine tables horizontally based on a predicate
- usually perform some sort of matching
	- left join
	- right join
	- inner join
	- cross join
- Sets
	- Union
	- Intersect
	- Stack tables vertically on top of each other
		- no predicate or matching involved
- Order by is a clause to organize the results 
	- order by desc/asc

##JDBC
- Java Database Connectivity
- Java Library for connecting and interacting with SQL database
- Do you have to download the appropriate JDBC driver for your database
	- postgres
	- mysql
- Key interfaces
	- Connection
	- Statement( NEVER USE THIS)
	- PreparedStatement
	- ResultSet
- SQL Injection
	- tricking an application into executing unintended SQL statement
