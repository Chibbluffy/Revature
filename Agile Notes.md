#Software Development lifecycle
- SDLC (circular)
- Requirement Analysis/Assessing the current situation
	- Decide what you have to work on
	- What are priorities
	- What is the current state of the application
- Design
	- Work out how to achieve goals
	- Setup application
- Implementation
	- Coding the application
- Testing
	- This blurs with implementation
- Evolution/monitoring/feedback
	- Find bugs
	- Find pain points
	- Find additional requested features 

#WaterFall (OLD)
- Follow a rigid one way path to completing the application
	- requirements document
		- labels everything needed in application
			- Features
			- tech to be used
			- how it will be tested
			- dates and deadlines
	- Design, Implement, Verify, Maintain
- Never skip a step
- Never go back a step
- Software engineering is not normal engineering
	- it is very easy to change past decisions
		- Ex. Building cannot redo a concrete foundation
	- It is possible to work on many different parts at once
		- Ex. You cannot install windows into a building if it does not have walls first
	- Software can be more flexible than other types of engineering
	- Software is also constantly changing 
		- Good and bad
		- A dependency may be a security risk
		- New updates are easy to add in

# Agile
- A paradigm of thinking
- not a specific implementation
	- more like guidelines
- The core principle is that you should be agile and be willing to adapt and change. Do not stick to a rigid structure
	- Agile manifesto
	- Tenets
		- Individuals over processes (communicate with people rather than focus on process)
		- Demos over documentation
			- it is much better to have a non complete demo than a word document describing what was done
		- Customer collaboration over contracts
			- Rather than a requirements document it is better to speak with the client every few days about progress and clarification on features
		- Adapting to change over following plan
			- software changes. You should learn from the projects and do it better
			- You should change as well

# SCRUM
- an implementation of agile
- Roles
	- Stakeholder(s)
		- Whoever hired you to make the application
		- for whom the application is for
	- Project owner
		- Represents the stakeholder and ultimately responsible for the application
	- Scrum Master(Lead)
		- usually the most senior developer on a team
		- will be in charge of giving programmers tasks
			- Part senior dev
			- part cheerleader
			- part manager
		- Goal is to make development as efficient as possible and remove barriers
	- Scrum members (scrumlings)
		- developers on a team
- Sprint
	- 2-3 week iteration on a project
	- applications should be incrementally built by these sprints
- Scrum Ceremonies
	- Day 1
		- User Stories and Story Pointing
		- Assigning users stories
	- Every day
		- Team standup 
			- Progress meeting
			- Every person on team gives quick progress update and asks for help if necessary
	- Last Day
		- Sprint retrospective
			- look at what went good
			- what went bad
			- what could have been done better
			-
