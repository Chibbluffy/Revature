#Angular
- front end framework
- Utilizes TS, not JS
- Designed by Google
- It is a SPA (Single Page Application)
	- Only one page on the front end and HTML is dynamically removed and updated
	- usually more efficient and easier to build with frameworks
- Angular is NOT AngularJS
	- Angular JS is the original
		- written in JS not TS
		- Different scopes
		- Very different from Angular 2.0+
	- Angular 2.0 and up are just called Angular
- default port 4200
- Angular is based on Components
	- small chunks of HTML/CSS/TS that we use to build a larger application
	- You can duplicate components
	- create custom components
	- makes the application modular and easier for a team to work on
