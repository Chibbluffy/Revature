#DevOps
- Development + Operations
- any piece of software requires development and operations
- Portmanteau (combination of 2 words)
	- DEV
		- coding
		- testing
		- planning
	- OPS
		- deployment
			- getting servers
			- buying domain name
		- monitoring
			- maintaining servers
		- performing updates
- In the past, it was separate
	- devs did one thing
	- IT infrastructure did another
- DevOps combines it so that both feed into the other
	- Dev might write new feature. 
	- when deployed, get feedback from monitoring logs
	- EX
		- dev write new save favorite orders feature
		- once developed, monitor
		- see traffic is up 60%
		- new feature is expanded upon
- heavily reliant on automation tools
	- GitHub: source control
	- Jenkins: build and test applications
	- Cloud Tech: easy automatic VMs/databases for application deployment
- Google does not have IT deployment people
	- SRE(Site Reliability people)
	- Google does not see reliability in finished applications as a deployment issue
	- They see reliability as part of the code as well

#CI, CD, CDD
- Continuous Integration
	- team of devs put all code into a central repo to build an application
	- every time a dev pushes code to the repo, it shoul automatically test and analyze code
		- sonarcloud?
	- Benefits
		- by constantly pushing code to repo and pulling, progress is never lost
		- allows devs to get feedback very quickly
			- peer review
			- autogenerated code analysis and test reports
- Continuous Delivery
	- One step beyond CI
	- If all tests are passed then a deliverable is created and stored somewhere
		- deliverable is a finished piece of software
- Continuous Deployment
	- One step beyond CD
	- if all steps pass, the deliverable will automatically be deployed to end users
		- Amazon does 9000 deployments a day
		- process is all automated
- Whole process of CI/CD/CDD is called setting up a pipeline

#Jenkins
- continuous integration build server
- can be set up to read repos
- can detect changes in repos
	- and can builds application with latest version of code
- Often the built application (deliverable) is then deployed on a separate server (deployment server)
- Jenkins Terminology
	- Job
		- a project in jenkins
		- configure
			- URL of repo
			- how to build project
				- we used gradle wrapper
			- when to build the app
				- build now, or on push
		- Build
			- any time jenkins runs build in a job
				- blue means successful

#SonarCloud
- Static code analysis
	- reads your code and tries to find problems in it
		- bad code practice
		- security vulns
		- potential bugs
		- offers suggestions and changes
- does not execute your tests to see if they work
	- its more of a computer peer review


#Continuous Integration steps
- Main branch will have a skeleton project initially
- NEVER push directly to the main branch
- Instead, create new branch named after feature being worked on
- push new code up to branch
- pull request feature branch into main
- other devs will perform code review
	- look at source code
	- tests
	- build
	- make sure build and tests work and application is not broken
- Approve/deny pull request
- merge if accepted
	- resolve merge conflicts if needed

Project: suggestion box application

Continuous integration steps
1. set up remote repo


You have been approached to add new feature to application
1. create a branch in github named for the feature you are writing
2. clone repo/fork
3. NEVER work on main branch
4. switch to new branch
5. Work on new branch
6. Make a pull request to the main branch
7. manager looks over test code and application code and build status
8. after verification, pull request will be merged
9.
